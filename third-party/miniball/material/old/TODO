Questions:
- Do we need size in Affine_sub_span<Traits>?
- Should Affine_sub_span<Traits>::clear() intialize to Q={p} instead of Q={}?
- Is it a good idea to update the radius after walking by computing the
  distance from the new center to the stopping point?  (We do this now
  because we don't "know" the index of a ball in Q right now...)

Possible optimization:
- Implement class Point<Float> with C-arrays instead of vectors -- I guess
  this doesn't help anything at all.
